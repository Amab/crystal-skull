# Crystal Skull

![Crystal Skull](crystal_skull.jpg)

For developers who want to build an innovative quiz app, Crystal Skull is a server that generates complete quizzes using just a topic name or supplied text. Unlike other quiz generators, our product is unique and easy to use.

The name _Crystal Skull_ comes from the movie _[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/)_. The movie shows an alien with a crystal skull who seems to have knowledge on everything. This program, too, seems to have knowledge on everything ðŸ˜‰.

Although he didn't convey how or what to do in any way, [Sundararaman](https://github.com/vsundar17697) showed me the idea of generating fill-in-the-blank questions using Wikipedia.
